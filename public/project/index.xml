      <description>Probabilistic Campaign Manifest Analysis Tool (PCMAT) was an excel based tool that would take in a manifest for a lunar campaign and run a simulation to evaluate various metrics about the campaign. I updated and expanded the capabilities of the this tool to track new metrics and increase the number of Bernoulli trials run within the course of a campaign. In addition, I improved the efficiency of the model through VBA and advanced EXCEL worksheet formulas.</description>

      <description>The teams in the Northern Virginia Senior Softball (NVSS) league are reorganized every year with the desire to make them as even as possible and promote social interactions. This projectâ€™s goals were to develop a methodology to produce team assignments for players such that the teams are equal in regards to player ability and other attributes. Multiple regression was employed to obtain offensive, defensive, and team metrics. An integer program (IP) model was developed where constraints were aligned with the goals of the NVSS league to solve the assignment problem.</description>
